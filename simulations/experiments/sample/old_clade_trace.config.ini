### everything comb-related is commented out (for convenience. mcref doesn't access these configurations when --clade is enabled)
#comb = root
#comb_leaves = A,B,C,D
#comb_mig_bands = D->B


clade = root

### 'hyp' pops and mig_bands are the pops and migbands you want to calculate exectly as gphocs did.
### With a root clade model, you would enter no pops (since they are all already contained inside the clade)
### and all the mig_bands (because you want them all to cancel out in rbf)
hyp_pops =
hyp_mig_bands = D->B

[Input]
trace_file = trace.sample.tsv
#comb_stats_file = comb-trace.sample.tsv
clade_stats_file = clade-trace.sample.tsv

### This is a new trace file which contains num_coal/migs+mig/coal_stats of the hypothesis model.
### (!) 1-  Since you do not have this file, and this data is contained within the clade_stats file, we
### will "mislead" mcref and point it to the same old file
hyp_stats_file = clade-trace.sample.tsv


[Templates]
### (!) 2- The latest code assumes the hypothesis data columns have different, new names. To override
### this we will tell mcref how the columns are called. This is how I make mcref backwards-compatible.
### There's no reason for you to touch this. just add it to any old clade config.ini.
clade_num_coals = {clade}_num_coals_total
clade_coal_stats = {clade}_coal_stats_total
hyp_migband_mig_stats = {migband}_mig_stats
hyp_migband_num_migs = {migband}_num_migs
hyp_pop_coal_stats = {pop}__pop_coal_stats_total
hyp_pop_num_coals = {pop}__pop_num_coals_total

skip_rows = 2000
number_of_rows = 6000

[Debug]
### This is the new debug configuration. You can enable debug and tell mcref how the original hypothesis was constructed.
debug = false
hypothesis_pops = A,B,C,D,AB,ABC,root
hypothesis_migbands = D->B
